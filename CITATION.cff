  EmpiRE-Compass is a neuro-symbolic dashboard that
  facilitates the exploration, synthesis, and reuse of
  empirical research knowledge in Requirements Engineering
  (RE). It integrates two complementary layers: A symbolic
  layer based on the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG)
  for structured, machine-actionable knowledge, and a neural
  layer leveraging large language models (LLMs) to answer
  both predefined and custom competency questions. This dual
  approach enables researchers to navigate the evolving
  knowledge landscape of empirical research in RE, identify
  reusable insights across publications, and promote Open
  Science through transparent, interoperable knowledge
  representations. EmpiRE-Compass currently focuses on two
  themes: Empirical research practices in RE using
  KG-EmpiRE, and empirical research practices in Natural
  Language Processing for RE using the NLP4RE ID Card.

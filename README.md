# EmpiRE-Compass

EmpiRE-Compass is a comprehensive platform that facilitates the exploration, reproduction, and enrichment of empirical research data within the KG-EmpiRE ecosystem. By leveraging live data from the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), EmpiRE-Compass offers researchers a suite of tools for data visualization, comparative analysis, and structured data contributionsâ€”all while aligning with ACM standards.

## Overview

EmpiRE-Compass serves as a central hub for empirical research data management within KG-EmpiRE. It is designed to:

- Present 16 core competency questions alongside their answers and visual diagrams.
- Provide interactive diagrams that fetch live data from ORKG, including lists of relevant papers and direct links.
- Enable reproduction of published states of KG-EmpiRE and comparison with live data snapshots.
- Offer statistical insights (e.g., counts of conferences, papers, triples, resources, and literals).
- Support a structured survey for authors to submit empirical research data, including paper DOIs and related metadata.
- Serve as a study designer knowledge base to help users find similar empirical research studies and receive design recommendations.

## Key Features

- **Dashboard Display:**  
  Visualizes the 16 competency questions with corresponding answers and diagrams to provide an at-a-glance view of KG-EmpiRE data.

- **Interactive Diagrams:**  
  Dynamically pulls live data from ORKG, displaying interactive diagrams with clickable elements that lead to related research papers.

- **Reproduction & Comparison:**  
  Allows users to review historical published states of KG-EmpiRE and compare them with current live data.

- **Statistics & Metrics:**  
  Presents real-time statistics such as the number of conferences, papers, triples, resources, and literals in the KG-EmpiRE.

- **Data Contribution Workflow:**  
  Integrates a survey system that collects key empirical research data (including paper DOIs and curator-reviewed submissions) for incorporation into ORKG.

- **Study Designer Knowledge Base:**  
  Helps users identify similar empirical research and offers design recommendations based on the accumulated knowledge within KG-EmpiRE.

- **Deployment:**  
  Optimized for hosting on GitHub Pages, accompanied by comprehensive documentation for easy setup and use.

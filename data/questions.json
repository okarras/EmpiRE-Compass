For this reason, we define that an empirical study is a study that includes data analysis as a necessary condition to be a study (Necessity) and data collection as a sufficient condition to be an empirical study (Sufficiency). Thus, a study must always include data analysis and an empirical study must include data collection and data analysis.

      "dataInterpretation": "<p>\n  Based on the figure \"Normalized number of empirical methods used for data collection per year\", we observe that mainly seven empirical methods are used for data collection. These seven methods are <em>case study</em> (192 times), <em>experiment</em> (128 times), <em>survey</em> (88 times), <em>interview</em> (86 times), <em>secondary research</em> (81 times), <em>action research</em> (10 times), and <em>study</em> as a default category (175 times). While the use of <em>experiment</em>, <em>survey</em>, and <em>interview</em> is more or less constant over time, we observe three important aspects:\n</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    The proportion of <em>case studies</em> decreases over time. We assume this change is a result of a clear definition of the term. According to \n    <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infsof.2021.106514\" target=\"_blank\">Wohlin</a>, the term case study is often misused in software engineering research. Based on the manual curation of the 570 papers, we can confirm this finding. Prior to 2013, we found many papers that use the term case study (with an average proportion of 53.2%), although at best they report an experiment or a larger use case in the sense of an application example. Despite the decrease, this finding represents a positive development of the empirical research in RE as researchers appear to be more aware of how a case study is defined.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    The proportion of <em>secondary research</em>, including literature reviews and archive analysis, is steadily increasing over time. While before 2010 the average proportion of secondary research is 11.5%, the average proportion for the period 2010 - 2019 is 16.4%. For the <strong>target state (2020 - 2025)</strong>, the average proportion of secondary research is already 40% which is more than double the previous averages. In the last year 2022 we observe the current maximum with a proportion of 50% of the analyzed papers using some kind of secondary research.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    The proportion of <em>action research</em> is constantly low over the entire analyzed timeframe (2000 - 2022). In all years analyzed, the proportion of action research is at most 10% of the respective papers with an overall average proportion of only 2%. Furthermore, as of 2018, there is no publication using action research.\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>\n  The default category <em>study</em> with 175 entries is quite extensive and requires a more fine-grained analysis in the future.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  Based on the figure \"Normalized number of empirical methods used for data analysis per year\", we observe that mainly four empirical methods are used for data analysis. These four methods are <em>descriptive statistic</em> (510 times), <em>inferential statistic</em> (104 times), <em>machine learning</em> (109 times), and <em>other method</em> as a default category (278 times). We observe four important aspects:\n</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    The proportion of <em>descriptive statistics</em> is constantly high with an average proportion of 87.6% of all papers reporting descriptive statistics over the entire analyzed timeframe (2000 - 2022).\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    The proportion of <em>inferential statistics</em> varies significantly but is relatively low overall with an average proportion of 19.2% of all papers reporting on data analysis over the entire analyzed timeframe (2000 - 2022).\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    The proportion of <em>machine learning</em> has increased slightly over time with its maximum of 58% in 2020. This increase reflects the current importance and high relevance of the topic of artificial intelligence in academia and industry.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    The proportion of <em>other methods</em> has its minimum with 36% in 2022 and its maximum with 94% in 2003. Based on the manual review of the 570 papers, we can report that these other methods often include some kind of <em>coding</em> as qualitative analysis method. For this reason, the default category <em>other method</em> requires a more fine-grained analysis in the future.\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>\n  The results show that over time, more and more papers report empirical studies using different empirical methods. In particular, there are essentially six different methods used for data collection and three different methods used for data analysis.\n</p>",

      "dataInterpretation": "<p>\n  Based on the figure \"Normalized number of statistical methods of descriptive statistics used for data analysis\", we observe that ten out of twelve statistical methods of descriptive statistics are used for data analysis. These ten methods are <em>count</em> (390 times), <em>percent</em> (266 times), <em>mean</em> (194 times), <em>range</em> (110 times), <em>minimum</em> (56 times), <em>standard deviation</em> (53 times), <em>median</em> (49 times), <em>maximum</em> (47 times), <em>boxplot</em> (43 times), <em>variance</em> (7 times), and <em>mode</em> (3 times). Most frequently the analyzed papers report <em>count</em> with a proportion of 86%, followed by <em>percent</em> with a proportion of 59%, <em>mean</em> with a proportion of 43%, and <em>range</em> with a proportion of at least 24%. These results show that researchers mainly report absolute (<em>count</em>) and relative (<em>percent</em>) values as well as averages. While they also report ranges occasionally, most other statistical methods of descriptive statistics are rarely used as they have a maximum proportion of 12% of the papers analyzed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  Based on the figure \"Number and Normalized number of statistical methods of inferential statistics used for data analysis\", we see that 57 statistical tests are reported in the 570 papers analyzed. A closer look at the names of the statistical tests extracted from the papers shows that there seems to be a large number of different spellings for partly the same test, such as the Mann-Whitney-U-test with 6 different spellings. Unfortunately, most papers do not provide a reference with which it could be determined more precisely whether all the different spellings really always refer to the same test. Overall, the maximum proportion of the most frequently used statistical tests (Wilcoxon signed rank test and Shapiro-Wilk test) is 2.9%. Thus, the application of statistical methods of inferential statistics seems to be, on the one hand, rather low and, on the other hand, very diverse.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  The results indicate that the envisioned use of statistical methods is not yet mature, as the overall and individual proportion of statistical tests is rather low and researchers already struggle with the consistent use of uniform names for the statistical tests applied.\n</p>",

      "dataInterpretation": "<p>\n  Based on the figure \"Normalized number of papers using X empirical methods for data collection and data analysis\", \n  we observe that papers use one to twelve empirical methods for data collection and analysis. \n  Most papers use three (31.3% proportion) to four (21.6% proportion) empirical methods. \n  The use of three or more methods in one paper requires the need for methods to synthesize evidence from \n  <strong>variety of perspectives and approaches</strong> as envisioned by \n  <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1109/FOSE.2007.30\">Sjøberg et al. (2007)</a>. \n  Based on our data, we cannot say whether such methods for synthesizing evidence are already available for the \n  <strong>target state (2020 - 2025)</strong> as envisioned. \n  However, our results imply, based on the increased number of methods used per paper, that there is such a need for methods to synthesize evidence.\n</p>",
      "question": "How many different research methods are used per publication?"
